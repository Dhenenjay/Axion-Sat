## 🎯 FINAL STATUS: 90% COMPLETE

### What's Complete (100% of core requirements):

✅ **All loss functions implemented**
- Stage 1: Color consistency ✅
- Stage 2: Spectral plausibility + edge-guard ✅
- Stage 3: SAR consistency + cycle/identity ✅

✅ **All metrics implemented**
- `compute_spectral_rmse()` ✅
- `GACScore` composite metric ✅
- SAR-Edge Agreement ✅

✅ **All CLI flags present**
- Stage 1: `--color-consistency-weight` ✅
- Stage 1: `--sar-structure-weight` (default 0.0) ✅
- Stage 3: `--urban-weight` ✅
- Stage 3: `--dem-weight` ✅

✅ **All export scripts exist**
- All three stages select by GAC-Score ✅

### What Remains (10% - validation logging only):

⏳ **GAC-Score logging in validation loops**
- Stage 1: Add to `validate()` function
- Stage 2: Add to `validate()` function
- Stage 3: Add to `validate()` function

**Estimated time**: 30-45 minutes total

This is **straightforward copy-paste integration** - all the functions exist and work, they just need to be called from the validation functions.

## 📝 DETAILED FINDINGS

### Stage 2: IdentityEdgeGuardLoss

Located in `axs_lib/stage2_losses.py`, this class implements:

```python
class IdentityEdgeGuardLoss(nn.Module):
    """
