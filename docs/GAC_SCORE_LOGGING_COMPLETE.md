## üéØ WHAT WAS COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION

### 1. Enhanced GACScore Class (`axs_lib/metrics.py`)

**Added batch accumulation interface:**

```python
class GACScore:
    def __init__(self, device=None, ...):
        # Added device parameter
        self.device = device
        self.reset()  # Initialize accumulation buffers
    
    def reset(self):
        """Reset accumulation buffers."""
        self.total_score = 0.0
        self.total_samples = 0
    
    def update(self, pred, target, sar):
        """Update with a batch of predictions."""
        gac_score = self(pred, target, sar)
        batch_size = pred.shape[0]
        self.total_score += gac_score * batch_size
        self.total_samples += batch_size
    
    def compute(self) -> Optional[float]:
        """Compute average GAC score across all batches."""
        if self.total_samples == 0:
            return None
        return self.total_score / self.total_samples
```

**Why this matters:**
- Enables proper metric accumulation across validation batches
- Consistent interface with other PyTorch metrics (like torchmetrics)
- Automatically handles batch-weighted averaging

---

### 2. Stage 1: TerraMind SAR-to-Optical (`scripts/train_stage1.py`)

**Added:**

1. **Import:**
   ```python
   from axs_lib.metrics import GACScore
   ```

2. **Validation function initialization:**
   ```python
   def validate(...):
       gac_metric = GACScore(device=device)
   ```

3. **Batch-wise accumulation:**
   ```python
   # Denormalize predictions and targets to [0, 1] range
   s2_pred_denorm = (s2_pred * std + mean).clamp(0, 1)
   s2_target_denorm = (s2_target * std + mean).clamp(0, 1)
   
   # Update GAC-Score
   gac_metric.update(s2_pred_denorm, s2_target_denorm, s1)
   ```

4. **Compute and return:**
   ```python
   gac_score = gac_metric.compute()
   if gac_score is not None:
       result['gac_score'] = gac_score
   ```

5. **Logging in training loop:**
   ```python
   if 'gac_score' in val_metrics:
       print(f"  GAC-Score: {val_metrics['gac_score']:.4f}")
   ```

6. **Checkpoint metadata:**
   ```python
   if 'gac_score' in val_metrics:
       checkpoint['gac_score'] = val_metrics['gac_score']
   ```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Only computes GAC-Score when S2 truth is available
- ‚úÖ Properly handles standardized data (denormalizes before scoring)
- ‚úÖ Includes GAC-Score in both regular and top-K checkpoints
- ‚úÖ Works with OOM retry mechanism

---

### 3. Stage 2: Prithvi Refinement (`scripts/train_stage2.py`)

**Added:**

1. **SAR data to dataset:**
   ```python
   # Extract SAR for GAC-Score (not used as model input)
   s1_vv = data.get('s1_vv', ...)
   s1_vh = data.get('s1_vh', ...)
   sar = np.stack([s1_vv, s1_vh], axis=0)
   
   sample['sar'] = torch.from_numpy(sar).float()
   ```

2. **Import:**
   ```python
   from axs_lib.metrics import GACScore
   ```

3. **Validation function:**
   ```python
   def validate(...):
       gac_metric = GACScore(device=device)
       
       for batch in val_loader:
           ...
           sar = batch.get('sar', None)
           if sar is not None:
               sar = sar.to(device)
               gac_metric.update(pred, target, sar)
       
       gac_score = gac_metric.compute()
       if gac_score is not None:
           avg_losses['gac_score'] = gac_score
   ```

4. **Logging:**
   ```python
   if 'gac_score' in val_losses:
       print(f"  GAC-Score: {val_losses['gac_score']:.4f}")
   ```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ SAR data loaded from tiles but not used in model forward pass
- ‚úÖ GAC-Score computed with Stage 2's refined optical output
- ‚úÖ Images already in [0, 1] range (no denormalization needed)
- ‚úÖ Gracefully handles missing SAR data

---

### 4. Stage 3: SAR Grounding (`scripts/train_stage3.py`)

**Added:**

1. **Import:**
   ```python
   from axs_lib.metrics import GACScore
   ```

2. **Validation function:**
   ```python
   def validate_epoch(...):
       gac_metric = GACScore(device=device)
       
       for batch in dataloader:
           ...
           opt_v3 = model(s1, opt_v2)
           gac_metric.update(opt_v3, s2_truth, s1)
       
       gac_score = gac_metric.compute()
       return {..., 'gac_score': gac_score}
   ```

3. **Logging:**
   ```python
   if 'gac_score' in val_stats:
       print(f"  Val GAC-Score: {val_stats['gac_score']:.4f}")
   ```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Computes GAC-Score on final grounded output (opt_v3)
- ‚úÖ Uses actual SAR data for edge agreement
- ‚úÖ Integrated with SAR agreement early stopping
- ‚úÖ Saved in checkpoint metadata

## üìà GAC-SCORE INTERPRETATION

### Score Range:
- **0.0 - 1.0** (normalized composite metric)
- **Higher is better** (unlike individual loss terms)

### Components:
1. **PSNR** (33% weight): Pixel-level reconstruction accuracy
2. **SSIM** (33% weight): Structural similarity
3. **SAR-Edge** (34% weight): Edge consistency with SAR

### What the scores mean:
- **0.85 - 1.00**: Excellent quality, production-ready
- **0.70 - 0.85**: Good quality, minor artifacts
- **0.50 - 0.70**: Fair quality, needs improvement
- **Below 0.50**: Poor quality, significant issues

### Stage-Specific Expectations:

**Stage 1 (Initial synthesis):**
- Target: 0.65 - 0.75
- Focus: SAR-edge agreement and color plausibility

**Stage 2 (Spectral refinement):**
- Target: 0.75 - 0.85
- Focus: Spectral accuracy (NDVI/EVI), improved SSIM

**Stage 3 (SAR grounding):**
- Target: 0.80 - 0.90
- Focus: Maximum SAR-edge agreement, final quality
