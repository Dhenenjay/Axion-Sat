# Strategy to Beat 83.446% mIoU Without Fine-Tuning

## Core Insight
TerraMind's frozen encoder is already excellent (proves by 83.446% baseline). The limitation is likely:
1. **Training time**: We only trained 80 epochs - possibly underfitting the decoder
2. **Learning rate**: May not be optimal for decoder training
3. **Data augmentation**: Not aggressive enough during training

## Intelligent Approach: Extended Decoder Training

### Method 1: **Train Decoder for 200 Epochs** 🎯
- Freeze encoder (keep pre-trained weights)
- Train ONLY the decoder head much longer
- Use stronger data augmentation
- Lower learning rate with cosine annealing

**Hypothesis**: The decoder hasn't fully learned to exploit TerraMind's features in 80 epochs.

### Method 2: **Ensemble Multiple Decoder Checkpoints**
- Take checkpoints at epochs 60, 80, 100, 120
- At inference, average predictions from all 4 checkpoints
- Different checkpoints capture different aspects

**Expected gain**: +1-3% mIoU from ensemble smoothing

### Method 3: **Self-Training / Pseudo-Labeling**
- Train baseline model (83.446%)
- Use it to predict on training set
- Mix real labels with high-confidence pseudo-labels (>0.95 confidence)
- Retrain decoder with augmented dataset
- This creates a "teacher-student" loop without touching encoder

**Expected gain**: +2-4% mIoU from self-distillation

### Method 4: **Decoder Architecture Search**
- Current: UPerNet with channels=512
- Try: channels=1024 (more capacity)
- Try: Different pooling scales in PSP module
- Try: Adding auxiliary loss heads at multiple scales

**Expected gain**: +1-2% mIoU from better decoder

### Method 5: **Smart Data Augmentation** ⭐
Most promising for quick wins:

```python
# Current: Basic random crop + normalize
# Enhanced: Aggressive training-time augmentation
augmentations = [
    RandomRotation90(),
    RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    RandomVerticalFlip(),
    ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2),
    GaussianBlur(kernel_size=3),
    RandomGamma(gamma_limit=(80, 120)),
    # Satellite-specific
    CloudShadowSimulation(),  # Add synthetic cloud shadows
    SeasonalShift(),  # Simulate seasonal NDVI changes
]
```

**Expected gain**: +2-5% mIoU from robust training

## Implementation Priority

### Quick Win (2 hours):
**Extended Training + Better Augmentation**
- Set `n_epochs=200` 
- Add stronger augmentation in preprocessing config
- Lower LR to 5e-5 with cosine decay
- **Expected: 85-86% mIoU**

### Medium Effort (1 day):
**Self-Training Loop**
- Generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled/weak-labeled data
- Mix with ground truth
- Retrain decoder
- **Expected: 86-88% mIoU**

### High Impact (2 days):
**Multi-Decoder Ensemble**
- Train 5 decoders with different:
  - Random seeds
  - Augmentation strategies  
  - Decoder widths (channels=512, 768, 1024)
- Ensemble at test time
- **Expected: 88-91% mIoU**

## Why This Works Without Fine-Tuning

1. **Pre-trained features are excellent** - TerraMind was trained on 500B tokens
2. **Decoder is the bottleneck** - Only 80 epochs isn't enough to fully exploit features
3. **Data augmentation teaches robustness** - Without changing features, make decoder more robust
4. **Ensemble reduces variance** - Multiple weak decoders → strong predictor
5. **Self-training leverages unlabeled structure** - Uses model's own predictions as weak supervision

## Next Steps

1. Start with extended training (200 epochs) + augmentation
2. If that reaches ~85%, add self-training
3. If that reaches ~87%, add ensemble
4. Target: **>90% mIoU** without touching encoder

This is the "train the decoder smarter, not the encoder harder" approach.
